Please follow the instructions given. The owner of this repository/code can be found @jackson.walker.18@cnu.edu


Please fork and clone from this: “https://github.com/GorgoGerbis/Siasi-Research-Programming-Litmus-Test” repository on Github. Make sure to upload all your code and a picture of your graph to your repository.

1) You are given a csv input file with rows of data indicating different types of food and their values. process the input file and use the data within to create objects.

2) Use the data from the input files to create an ENUM class for each different food from the input file. For example if the file contains “pizza, burgers, apples, carrots” the enums should be “PIZZA = 0, BURGERS = 1, APPLES = 2…” ect.

3) Create a method that sorts the objects from the foodInput.csv file by each of their given attributes. The sorting will depend on the input parameter indicating the attribute to sort by.

4) Create a bar graph using the matplotlib library with the data in the first input file. X-axis should be the given food objects with the y-axis being the caloric value of said objects.

5) Create some different class methods for each class that returns or modifies a specific object.

    5a) Method with the highest calories object from that class.

    5b) Method with the lowest fat object from that class.

    5c) Method upping the calories of a given object by an integer parameter.
